DPlus Backend REST API:

(following the recommendations here: https://pages.apigee.com/rs/351-WXY-166/images/ebook-2013-03-wad.pdf?mkt_tok=3RkMMJWWfF9wsRonuKTNde%2FhmjTEU5z17uQrXaaxgYkz2EFye%2BLIHETpodcMRctiNK%2BTFAwTG5toziV8R7PALc13wswQWhfk)

All access will be with the following URL prefix: /api/v1

Authentication will be done with OAuth 2.

Errors will be returned with JSON, as well as with the proper HTTP response code.

Internally the Django web application will take these API calls and convert them 
into the JSON format ued by the current backend.
