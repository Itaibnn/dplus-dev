-Change usage of:		originally defined in
	* graphTable		structurefitting.h and calculation_external.h
	* bgStruct			bgfitting.h and calculation_external.h
	* cailleParamStruct	structurefitting.h and calculation_external.h

-Define/implement EDPFunction

* Create FrontendCom
* JobPtr (set as new job for now, as opposed to loading an existing one)

BUGS:
* When not in LiveRefresh, generated graph isn't retrieved.
* Fitting with a mask crashes the program.
* When changing peak types, all peaks are erased. Presumably, this will
	happen when changing models as well.
* Related models in the Options menu has irrelevant models

TODO List
* Change models (handleModelChange)
	- Change model for FF
	- Decide what to do about existing parameters when changing models
* Ini managment
	- Move to XML?
* Background
	- Resolve issue of FunctionName <--> Enumeration
	- Implement
	- Implement constraints
	- Crop and baseline
* Structure Factor
	- Implement constraints
* Phases
	- New type of job?
	- Generate
	- Fit
* Options
	- Change time to refresh from backend (different for local vs remote)
* Polydispersity
	- Fails in CombinedModel::Precalculate --> OrganizeParameters(p, nLayers)
