Milestone V - Finalization
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
BUGS:
	* Crashes in OpeningWindow when there is a selected External model and a different radio button is clicked:
		An unhandled exception of type 'System.AccessViolationException' occurred in X+.exe
		Additional information: Attempted to read or write protected memory. This is often an indication that other memory is corrupt.
		
		Occurs in OpeningWindow::radioButton_CheckedChanged at:
			// Deleting previous model, if exists
			if(_currentModel)
				delete _currentModel; // Crashes here!!
	  - Update: Put problematic statement in try/catch. CAUSES MEMORY LEAK!!!

	* Adaptive arbitrary ED doesn't seem to work anymore

	* Arbitrary ED for symmetric slabs does not converge to discrete model as slope increases

	* When the a1nm1 is selected and a form factor has been loaded from a file,
		if there is no compatible region and a call to UpdateGraph is made before 
		changing this, then _ff->y will be empty and the program will crash.

	* Complete the models:
		- Cuboid
			+ The current model (Avi's implementation) does not coincide with the previous model.
	
    * finite GHC should say it's slow - it checks if H is infinite. this is not a good check as it only changes in PreCalculate.
	
	* Loading a discrete model with arbitrary ED profiles will result in an empty initial drawing of the ED profile.
	  Modifying a parameter seems to fix this.
	  
-----------------------

General:

	* Move solvent ED from first layer to extra parameters

	! MAJOR code cleanup (MA leftovers, documentation[doxygen])
	
	* Program manual
	
------------

Backend:

	? LM that uses Function, Gradient and Hessian 
		  (see http://www.alglib.net/optimization/levenbergmarquardt.php
		   and http://www.alglib.net/optimization/lbfgs.php)

	? Consolidate all the 'EXPORTED' .h files and calculation_external.h

	? Finish Differential Evolution: 
		* Immutable parameters
		* Real evolution goes out of the parameter range
	
------------

Frontend:
	* Ranges for structure factor parameters

	* Tab indexing arrangement

Milestone VI - Beyond X+
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Non-X+:
	+ Modeling Thermal Fluctuations
	
	+ Multiple Populations (be it models or phases)
	
	? 2D Sample Analysis for samples with partial alignment (using magnetic field or substrates or shear)
	
Docking Program:
	+ Multiple Models and interference
	+ Docking of lipids and/or protein structures using structure factor formalism
	
Time resolved analysis (TRA):
	+ GUI Idea: the user selects this mode
			does a regular fit
			when finished, a new window opens
			in this window, the user can add and rearrange files,
			select which tabs will undergo fitting, select mutable parameters and ranges
			when all this is complete, the user presses a button and fitting starts
			each file starts with the results of the previous file.
			all the parameters are saved to individual ini files with a slightly different name (filename-seriesParams.ini?)
		* Possible issue: initial background subtraction
	+ The previous idea does not take a "global fit" approach (i.e. find the best FF when the SF changes throughout the series)
		For that, we can probably use the same GUI, but will need to rethink the backend.
	+ Another aspect of this is when a given signal is composed of N different contributions. Each
		contribution is scaled by A_i giving the relative populations in the sample.
